\section{Introduction}

Magnetization manipulation by femtosecond laser pulses is a topic on current interest in magnetism. 
A possibility of all-optical switching of the magnetization was observed first in a thin films of ferrimagnetic GdFeCo alloys \cite{stanciu2007all}. 
Later, all-optical helicity dependent switching (AO-HDS) was demonstrated also in a number of rare-earth transition metal (RE-TM) materials. 
Materials of this kind have two sublattices that are coupled antiferromagnetically. 
The model described AOS in the materials of this kind 
is based on the nonequivalent response of the two sublattices and the angular momentum transfer between them\cite{ostler2012ultrafast}.
Recently, AO-HDS was demonstrated in ferromagnetic Co/Pt multilayers \cite{Lambert12092014, Mangin2014}. The complete understanding of the AO-HDS in ferromagnetic multilayers is still missing and needed to be studied.

\section{Experiment}

In the experiment we studied transparent Co/Pt and Co/Pd multilayer samples with  structure Ta(1.5\,nm)Pt(3\,nm)[Co(0.4\,nm)Pt(0.7\,nm)]$_X$ Pt(1.3\,nm), where $X$ = 1, 2, 3, 5 for Pt and $X$ = 2, 3, 5, for Pd. 
Co/Pt and Co/Pd interfaces lead to a spin-orbital coupling, resulted in perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA).
The samples with Pt and with Pd have different magnitude of the coercive field. For samples with Pd it is $\approx$\,700\,Oe and for Pt is $\approx$100\,Oe. 
Samples were prepared by magnetron sputtering in argon atmosphere\,\cite{Hellwig200713, pierce2013influence}.

	\label{fig:CoPtCoPdHyst}
\end{figure}

The magnetic domain structure was studied with a magneto-optical imaging technique.
We used a femtosecond pulsed laser system  with a tunable pulse width in a range from 40\,fs up to 5\,ps, with a central wavelength of 800\,nm and a repetition rate of 1\,kHz. 
In the experiments the pulse width was set to 2\,ps.
The helicity of the beam is controlled by a quarter-wave plate, which transforms linearly polarized light (L) into circularly left- ($\sigma^+$) or right- ($\sigma^-$) polarized light. 
The quality of circular polarization was 80$\%$. 
Typical laser power for 1 kHz repetition rates were $0.2\,$-$\,0.3$\,mW.
The laser is focused to a spot with a Gaussian intensity profile
with a full width at half maximum of 60\,$\mu$m.
A white light fiber lamp was used as a probe light source.
The probed light was detected with CCD camera.
The intensity of the collected light depends on the sample magnetization orientation what developed in the image contrast.
All measurements were performed at the room temperature.

	\caption{CoPt sample magnetization after trains of 33 pulses. }
	\label{fig:AOS_fin_from_width}
\end{figure}

Samples of Pd and Pt with $X$ = 1, 2 show the presence of all-optical switching.
The samples with repetition of 3 and more show only thermal demagnetization.

In the first experiment we want to show how the duration of laser pulses affects the sample magnetization.
The sample was exposed to trains of laser pulses.
In the illuminated area we observe an area with domains of the reversed magnetization.
The size of the area is defined by the laser fluence and pulse train duration. 
The  value of magnetization was obtained by integration the magnetization over the illuminated area.
We have fixed laser fluence at 15\,mJ/cm$^2$ and start to vary the length of the pulses.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:AOS_fin_from_width} is shown final magnetization of the spot after the trains of 33 pulses in CoPt sample. 
For pulses  of a length less then $\approx$1\,ps we observe that the number of domains in the states M$\uparrow$ and M$\downarrow$ is equal and as a result the average magnetization is zero.
For pulses of a length more than $\approx$1\,ps the average magnetization start to deviate from zero. 
However, we did not observe the complete switching. The maximum rate was estimated as $\approx 70\,\%$.
With the increase of the duration of the single pulse the maximum instantaneous power of the pulse decreases.
The total amount of heat transferred to the sample for short and for long pulses was kept the same.
Final magnetization in the spot area increases with broadening of the pulse, while the spot size decreases in the same time, indicating that for switching instantaneous power of the pulse is important rather than total transferred power.
For laser fluence of 15\,mJ/cm$^2$ the curve has a stop point at a value of $\approx$2.2\,ps (see Fig.\,\ref{fig:AOS_fin_from_width}).  
The pulses with a width more than 2.2\,ps show no visually detectable effect on the surface, no magnetic contrast is observed. 
For pulse trains of longer duration or for higher laser fluences the change of the magnetization can be observed for  pulse widths beyond 2.2\,ps.
For small number of pulses  the curves stops before forking point.

The spatial beam profile has a Gaussian shape. 
Since the surface is sensible to the excitation,
the spot area is heated non-uniformly and follows the intensity profile.
There can be distinguished 2 threshold values: at intensities more than I$_0$ the domain walls (DW) are able to move under the laser illumination.
For intensities above I$_1$ there is a region in the spot in a multidomain state, what points out that it was overheated above the Curie temperature.
The overheated region is inside the region with suppressed magnetization.
A ring-shape area is formed around the overheated region, which corresponds to a laser fluence I (I$_0<$I$<$I$_1$)  according to the Gaussian profile of the laser spot\,\cite{vahaplar2012all}. 
For the samples, where the switching was observed, we measured the values of I$_0$ and  I$_1$ for different samples. The result is in the table.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ l | c | c | r }
		\hline
		Substrate & Sample & I$_0$ & I$_1$ \\ \hline
		\multirow{3}{*}{Glass} & (CoPt)$_1$ &  &  \\ 
		& (CoPt)$_2$ & 5.8 & 6.8 \\ 
		& (CoPd)$_2$ & 14.5 & 16.1 \\ \hline
		\multirow{3}{*}{MgO} & (CoPt)$_1$ & $\approx6 \pm 2$ & $\approx7 \pm 2$ \\ 
		& (CoPt)$_2$ & 9 & 10.2 \\ 
		& (CoPd)$_2$ & 14.8 & 16.1 \\ 		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:1}
\end{center}

The laser fluence for CoPd samples was in average higher (16-17\,mJ/cm$^2$) than for CoPt, when we observe visual change of the magnetization. 
The difference in fluence value was also observed for glass and MgO substrates. 
The glass substrate has C = 1\,W/m\,K and MgO substrate has C = 56\,W/m$\cdot$K.
Laser fluence for MgO substrate is higher. 
MgO substrate has higher thermal conductance.
So, for MgO the part of the substrate takes heat. In case of the  substrate made of glass heat dissipates into substrate longer.
For CoPt we observe variation in the power needed to move the domains very well.
Similar effect for CoPd was very weak so it is not possible to distinguish for different substrates. 

The combination of the continuous exposing and sweeping the beam over the surface produce a trail of certain magnetization which depends on the laser pulse polarization.
The quality of the trail depends on the pulse length and the sweeping speed.
If the trail is not uniform   it consists of domain of different magnetization. 
A close look at the trail reveal that the domains form a distinctive pattern: they are stretched in the direction of movement of the beam and are tilted to the center of the beam spot (Fig.\,\ref{fig:domainShape}). 
Similar effect is observed for trails left after the beam polarized  linearly.
The laser pulses create the multidomain area by overheating the excited area. The domain tends to move to the direction of the spot center.
The movement of the domain walls is involved in the process of trail formation.

\begin{figure}[h!]

	\caption{ (Co/Pt)$_2$ The shape of the domain in the trace. Domains are stretched along the beam movement direction and also to the center of the beam spot}
	\label{fig:domainShape}
\end{figure}


To investigate how the domains moves  we have monitored
how the spot is formed when the sample is initially thermally demagnetized (Fig.\,\ref{fig:CoPt2CoPd2}).
For this we used a linearly polarized laser beam with fluence of $\approx$20\,mJ/cm$^2$.
The demagnetized sample has a multidomain state.
Then we have excited the sample with circularly polarized laser beam and low fluence ($\approx\,$9\,mJ/cm$^2$ for Pt and $\approx\,$15\,mJ/cm$^2$ for Pd) and monitor how the spot will form.
The region start to be magnetically weaker due to the which domain walls moves easier\,\cite{Talapatra2016}.
Domains walls shrinks to minimize the magnetostatic energy.
Formation of the domains of bigger size is observed. 
The experiment shows that $\sigma^+$ ($\sigma^-$) polarized laser excitation stimulate the growth of the white (black) domains.
We observe also that domains move toward the spot center.
When two domains are in touch they are merging and creating  domain of a larger size.
As a result the area of uniform magnetization is formed.

	\centering
	\caption{Spot formation for (CoPt)$_2$ and (CoPd)$_2$ on glass and on MgO substrate.}
	\label{fig:CoPt2CoPd2}
\end{figure}


If the laser fluence is high enough ($>$I$_1$), the center of the spot is constantly overheated. 
Domains will accumulate around the overheated spot forming a ring (Fig.\,\ref{fig:ringANDdomainFormation}).  
The domain walls behavior is similar for the central spot region for laser pulse of low power and for rim ring region for the laser pulse of high power.   
For a linearly polarized light of low fluence we still observe that new domains are emerging, moving and forming randomly larger domains.
However, there is no ordered motion  towards the center of the spot, only chaotic movement is observed.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\includegraphics[width=7cm]{ringFormation2}
	\centering
	\caption{Domain formation ((CoPd)$_2$ on MgO) for high laser fluence  (17\,mJ/cm$^2$\,$>$\,I$_1$). Central part is overheated and demagnetized. It has a multidomain structure. Around the central spot a ring of uniform magnetization is forming. Color of the domain depends on the helicity of the pump.}
	\label{fig:ringANDdomainFormation}
\end{figure}

	
In the next experiment we have studied how the DW moves under the laser excitation.
We chose the area where there are two big domains with strait domain wall.
The distance between the center of laser pulse and the DW
was around 20$-$30\,$\mu$m.
Analyzing pulse to pulse evolution of the magnetization in the illuminated area we observe the displacement of the domain wall.
The direction of the domain wall displacement can be controlled using the helicity of the laser.
In case of $\sigma^+$ ($\sigma^-$) polarized excitation of the black (white) domain the DW moves in a way to enlarge area of white (black) domain. DW moves towards the excited ares (Fig.\,\ref{fig:CoPddomainsANDlight}, columns 1 and 3).
However, in case of   $\sigma^+$  polarized excitation of the black (white) domain the DW moves in a way to enlarge white domain (Fig.\,\ref{fig:CoPddomainsANDlight}, columns 1 and 2).

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\includegraphics[width=7cm]{CoPddomainsANDlight}
	\centering
	\caption{
		Displacement of the domain wall is (CoPd)$_2$.
		 Column 1:  black domain is illuminated with a $\sigma^+$ polarized pump in the vicinity of the domain wall. DW moves right.

		 Column 3:  white domain is illuminated with a $\sigma^-$ polarized pump in the vicinity of the domain wall. DW moves left.
		}
	\label{fig:CoPddomainsANDlight}
\end{figure}

The velocity of the DW follows the spatial Gaussian profile of the pump pulse. The maximum speed is observed, when the border crosses the center of the pumped area (see Fig.\,\ref{fig:AOS_DWmove}).

\end{figure}

Fig.\,\ref{fig:pumpVSpower}  shows an evolution of the magnetic contrast under the continuous laser pumping as a function of the laser fluence. 
The sample is initially saturated with a magnetic field and 
the laser fluence was set to minimum.
The sample is continuously irradiated by a with a circularly polarized laser pulses. 
We have gradually increased the laser fluence from 3\,mJ/cm$^2$ to 21\,mJ/cm$^2$ and afterwards decreased it back to the initial value.
For laser fluence of 6.5\,mJ/cm$^2$, white spot of new magnetization state emerges for the first time.
It grows with an increase of the laser fluence.
For the fluence of $\approx$8\,mJ/cm$^2$ we start to observe emergence of new phase inside the white spot.
New phase corresponds to the multidomain state when we overheat above Curie temperature.
The magnetization of the ring region depends on the polarization of the laser beam.
The magnetization of the ring does not change while we decreased laser power,
while the overheated central region decrease in size.
At the end we observed uniform spot of the switched magnetization.

Our experiment show no single-shot switching of the magnetization. 
However, for trains of wide pulses a  helicity dependent switching is presented.
We want to propose the next possible mechanism of the switching with multiple pulses. 
For I$_0$ amplitude of the pulse the energy transferred to the sample is more than energy that dissipates. 
As a result, sample heats up for laser pulses with amplitude more than I$_0$ . 
The region start to be magnetically weaker due to the which domain walls moves easier\,\cite{Talapatra2016}. 
For pulses with amplitude more than I$_1$ we overheat the sample over Curie temperature ($\approx550$\,K) and demagnetized it. Demagnetized sample has multidomain structure with domains magnetized up and down. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\includegraphics[width=7cm]{mech-pulse}
	\centering
	\caption{Important parameters of the pulse.}
	\label{fig:mech-pulse}
\end{figure}

At the moment t$_0$ the pulse reaches the surface. 
At the moment of t$_1$ the central region of the spot reaches Curie temperature. Between time moments t$_1$ and t$_2$ the core region of the spot is overheated above the Curie temperature and this part of sample is demagnetized. 
From the literature we know it is needed 0.5-1\,ps for sample to be demagnetized\,\cite{Koopmans2010}. After the time moment t$_2$ sample still needs time to demagnetized. Between time moments t$_2$ and t$_3$ the pulse still bring energy to the sample and keep it ``warm''. During this time domain walls move.
Also, the ring area is ``warm'' and the movement of the domain walls here occurs easier.   
Domains become bigger due to moving and merging. 
Due to the inversed Faraday effect the effective H-field in the central region is nonzero for nonlinearly polarized laser beam. 
The domains with the magnetization along the field will move to the center and push the domains of other magnetization out to the border or make them disappear. 
For linearly polarized light is observed only the growth of the domain and its random movement.
